# WP Flex (a Wordpress ACF boilerplate)

A boilerplate template for creating scalable, component-based themes in Wordpress.

This is just a basic starter kit for developing lightweight custom Wordpress themes. I've built several dozen Wordpress sites using this theme/schema which largely relies on the [flexible content sections](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/flexible-content/) of Advanced Custom Fields ([ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com)).

### Built-in Features:

- ACF theme options
- ACF JSON saves
- ACF custom stylesheet
- ACF basic components
- ACF flexible content init
- WP comments removed
- WP CPT template
- WP custom login logo
- JS main script enqueue
- SCSS scheme init
